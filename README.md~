A social networking site made with php and mysql that has features like writing posts,choosing profile pics,displaying other members,following and followers.

Its not mobile friendly.....

Its a basic social networking site that uses their social feed and only done using html,css,php and mysql.

The first page is signing in and signing out.
After signing up or signing in You are redirected to your profile where you can choose your profile picture and also post a data with time and date specified.
Next side to it we have members displayed who are signed up  in this site and when you click their pics you are redirected to their profiles.You can see their posts and 
either follow or unfollow them .
If you follow other members your home page will be displayed with the posts of those you followed.


   Its difficult for mysql injection because I used few mysql functions that makes it hard to inject.

The first page that is sign in page has no javascript validation or only fewer forms.I used jquery splash which rotates and shows the loaded data until page gets completly loaded.Also as user enters his email id ,then a registered users  pofile pic will be displayed on side.

  And also you have to import the mysql file that are having specific tables and data.
